Python3 / Pygame pandemic simulation SIR model

This is an pandemic simulation using SIR model made with Python 3 and Pygame. The simulation can be configured for the inteded usage. It has 4 different modes which are normal, common place, communites, and air transportation simulations. User can play with the modes and see how do certain situtaions affect the spread of the disease. User can also change the parameters such as speed of the people, infection probability, infection radius, removal time etc... At the end of the simulations, graphs pop up. Those graphs show necessary information about the history of the virus like the infected person number and basic reproduction number over time. 

The blue squares represents susceptibles and red ones represent infected population. After a certain amount of time, those infected will be turn gray meaning that they are removed and can not spread the virus. 


The parameters of the simulation can be changed from the variables in the begininng of the runSimulation and communitySimulation functions. 

WARNING: The simulation might freeze in the middle of it. Try re-running it.

ps: Any advices would be aprreciated.
